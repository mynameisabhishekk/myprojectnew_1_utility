# Design of Three phase Induction Motor with Premium efficiency standards

## Introduction
With the rising costs of energy and the substantial concerns
about global C02 emissions, achieving the highest possible
motor system efficiency has become a critical priority.
Subsequently, stringent energy efficiency standards are being
implemented by several countries to introduce energy efficient
motors for energy savings.
